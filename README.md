Salary prediction practice project (Python)


## Project Summary
This project develops a machine learning model that predicts a salary of a person based on their background information.


## Dataset:
1,000,000 entries.
	The features of the dataset:
Categorical:
Nominal:
Major
Industry
companyID
jobID
Ordinal:
jobType
Degree
Numerical:
yearsExperience
milesFromMetropolis
salary




## Approach
1-  Exploratory data analysis
2 - baseline model. Have a simple model first: predicting salary of a person based on one feature alone, that is industry. Then calculate the error rate for this baseline model. The metric that I use here is MSE.
3- Data preprocessing. Process the data so that it can be prepared to be put into ML models.
4- Developing ML models. I choose 4 different models and pick one that performs the best
5- Tune the one model that is selected.
6- Feature importance graph.
